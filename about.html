            <div class="history">
                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The Green Orchard Farmers Market was established in 1980 with the aim of providing fresh, locally-grown produce to the community. Over the years, we have expanded our market to include a variety of vendors offering everything from fresh vegetables and fruits to handmade crafts and artisanal products.
                However, in recent decades, there has been a resurgence of interest in farmers markets due to growing concerns about food quality, sustainability, and supporting local economies. They play a vital role in promoting healthy eating, supporting small-scale farmers, and fostering a sense of community.

                <p>Our Mission is to support local farmers and artisans by providing them with a platform to sell their products directly to consumers. We believe in the importance of sustainable farming practices and aim to promote health eating habits within our community.
